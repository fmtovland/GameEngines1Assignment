# Original Intention
It all starts with a seed. This is a pun. A seed as in a little bit of random data, where following the rules with the same random data would always yield the same result. A seed can also become a tree. And that is what the randomly generated seed will become. A tree. A tree that can produce leaves and branches, and seeds of it's own, and those seeds will become more trees. Moment by moment the trees will grow, till from a single tiny seed, a great forest is born. For the sake of visual flavor, elements like a day and night cycle, wind, rain, snow and the occasional forest fire shall occur.
